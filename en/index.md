Welcome! Computational imaging and AI researcher with experience in medical image segmentation, motion-artifact correction, and quantitative analysis. 

I work on **AI for medical imaging** (OCT motion artifact correction, skin perfusion/segmentation) and **human-centered LLM systems** (prompt optimization for mental health chatbots).

I design and implement deep-learning pipelines (FCN, 3D U-Net with CBAM) for clinical and biomedical imaging using Python/PyTorch on GPU clusters. 

I am particularly interested in building clinically useful and trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.
