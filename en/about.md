**Computational medical imaging**: automated segmentation, and motion/artifact correction for 2D/3D and time-resolved data (dermatology, retinal OCT).
**Deep learning for image analysis**: FCN and 3D U-Net (with CBAM), GPU-accelerated training, and large-scale experiment management.
**Quantitative evaluation**: morphometric and intensity-based features, PSNR / SSIM / MAE, and statistical comparison of models and pipelines.
**Data workflows for large imaging datasets**: preprocessing, augmentation, dataset versioning, and reproducible analysis pipelines on GPU servers in collaboration with clinicians and engineers.
