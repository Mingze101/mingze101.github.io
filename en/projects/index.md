<summary><strong>11/2024 – 04/2025 · Master Thesis — <em>Designing an Iterative Prompt Optimization System for Domain-Specific Chatbots</em></strong></summary>

- Designed and implemented an iterative **multi-agent debating** system to refine prompts for a mental-health support chatbot.
- Grounded the system in **Design Science Research**, with design principles informed by **Cognitive Load Theory** and **Adaptive Structuration Theory**.
- Automated **synthetic dialogue generation** and **GPTScore-based evaluation**, keeping domain experts in the loop via an interactive web interface.
- Conducted a **mixed-methods user study** (experts & lay users; **PHQ-9**, **NASA-TLX**, qualitative feedback) and derived prescriptive design implications.

<summary><strong>11/2023 – 03/2024 · Behavioral Activation Chatbot</strong></summary>

- Developed a BA chatbot using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline and a **fine-tuned GPT-3.5** model.
- Implemented **mood tracking**, **personalized activity recommendations**, four **incentive mechanisms**, and **schedule management** via the Google Calendar API to support sustained engagement.
- Ran a **SurveyMonkey** user study *(n = 25)* to evaluate usability, mood-tracking accuracy, and impact on BA, showing positive effects on users’ self-management and well-being.

<summary><strong>11/2023 – 03/2024 · Engineering Interactive Systems & EIS Capstone Project</strong></summary>

- Collected **multimodal data** (eye-tracking, HR, PPG, accelerometer, mouse clicks & movement) on an **ABB operator-training simulator** to study workload and performance in a realistic workplace.
- Designed analyses and visual reports to give operators and supervisors feedback on **stress**, **attention**, and **performance**.
- Prototyped a **biosignal-adaptive smartwatch interface**, exploring how physiological data can be integrated into everyday work to support safer and more efficient operation.
